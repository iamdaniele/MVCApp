MVCApp
==================

It's a Model-less MVC microframework (~90 SLOC) for [Appcelerator Titanium Mobile](http://appcelerator.com). Provides barebone functionality.

What's inside
=============

*	 View-Controller architecture. You create a Controller. A Controller can dispatch actions. An action can create a View.
*	 Platform detection (Android/iOS so far).
*	 Platform-specific views. By default, MVCApp will be looking for views under your project's Resources/Views directory. You can place Android-specific views into
	 Resources/android/Views (keep the same filename).
*	 A very basic test/example.
*	 Possibly some bugs.
